This tool is needed when using Nucleus with SQLite as database engine.


****************************** How to use ******************************

  When installing Nucleus, the access-ID and password are not required. SQLite
uses normal file as database.  This is fixed to "nucleus/sqlite/.dbsqlite" 
(if you would like another file name, please set it in "sqlite.php" file). 
Set the permission of "nucleus/sqlite/" directory to 777 or something like this. 
Then execute install.php. That's it! If you see the install-complete message, 
probably the install is succeded.  NP_SkinFiles as well as NP_SQLite are 
automatically installed.  If not, install it manually.

  The usage of Nucleus is almost (99%) the same as that of normal Nucleus.  When
installing plugins, NP_SQLite will convert the plugin files automatically if the
permission of these files is set to be writable.
