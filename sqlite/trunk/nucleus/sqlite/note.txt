  I thank all the people of Nucleus JP forum 
  who discussed this project. Especially, I 
  thank kosugiatkips, mekyo, and nakahara21 
  for ideas of some part of code.
  I also thank Jon Jensen for his generous
  acceptance for using his PHP code in the
  earlier version of this library.

  The features that are supported by this library but not
  generally by SQLite are as follows:

  CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS, auto_increment,
  DROP TABLE IF EXISTS, ALTER TABLE,
  RENAME TABLE, DESC,
  INSERT INTO ... SET xx=xx, xx=xx,
  REPLACE INTO ... SET xx=xx, xx=xx,
  SHOW KEYS FROM, SHOW INDEX FROM,
  SHOW FIELDS FROM, SHOW COLUMNS FROM,
  CREATE TABLE ... KEYS xxx (xxx,xxx)
  SHOW TABLES LIKE, TRUNCATE TABLE
  SHOW TABLES
