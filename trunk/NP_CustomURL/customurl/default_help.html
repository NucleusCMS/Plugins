<h3>Outline of plug-in</h3>

<p>

It is a plug-in that replaces dynamic URL generated with NucleusCMS with static URL of a free name.<br />
<em style="color:#cc0000;">Operation only in FancyURL mode and required 'mod-rewrite'.</em><br />
Categories, the Sub-Categories, Archive list, etc. are considered to be a directory respectively.When narrowing it by the category, it becomes an image that refers to the index file that exists in the directory of a category concerned.<br />
<ul style="margin:0 0 25px 12px;">ex.
<li>Image of access to Categories:
<ul><li>http://example.jp/nucleuscms/</li></ul></li>
<li>Image of access to Sub-Categories:

<li>Image of access to Archives:
<ul><li>http://example.jp/archives/</li><li>http://example.jp/archives/nucleuscms/</li></ul></li>

<p>

<ol style="margin:0 0 25px 12px;">
<li>After up-loading the "NP_CustomURL.php" file and the "customurl" directory that can be done by developing the downloaded compression file to the "plugins" directory of the server.It installs it from the management area.</li>
<li>First of all, "URL mode" is changed to "Fancy" on "Global setting" page of the management screen.</li>
<li>"fancyurls.config.php" is copied to a top directory according to the procedure of FancyURLs and it edits it.<br />At this time, copying it should not copy the following file with "fancyurls.config.php" file alone.</li>
<li>Next, "index.php" is edited."<code>$CONF['Self']</code>" and the line that is are rewritten as "<code>$CONF['Self'] = '.'</code>" and One line is written "<code>$curl_blogid = 1;</code>" and it adds. ("1" is ID of Brog accessed by "index.php".)
<blockquote><pre style="overflow:auto;">&lt;?php
// This file will generate and return the main page of the site
$CONF = array();
$CONF['Self'] = '.';
$curl_blogid = 1;

include('./config.php');
include('./fancyurls.config.php');

selector();

?&gt;
</pre></blockquote>
</li>
<li>Next, <code>.htaccess</code> is edited.<ul>
    <li>The content is here.<blockquote><pre style="overflow:auto;">RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php?curl=$1 [L,QSA]
